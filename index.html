                <h4>Legacy</h4>
                Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura's series Berserk impacted the manga
                medium and beyond, with journalist Jade King stating: "[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous
                impact his work has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and even literature." The image of
                Guts and his massive sword is attributed to inspiring characters like Cloud Strife of <em>Final Fantasy
                    VII</em> and Dante from the <em>Devil May Cry</em> series, with the overall aesthetic of Berserk
                inspiring the monsters and world of the Dark Souls series. Video game director Hideaki Itsuno and
                producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi are fans of Berserk, and the role-playing hack and slash game <em>Dragon's
                    Dogma</em> included armor based on Guts and Griffith's. During a GDC talk in 2019, Itsuno stated
                that the tone and style of <em>Devil May Cry 5</em> was inspired from <em>Berzerk</em>.
